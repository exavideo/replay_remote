Exavideo Replay Remote
----------------------

This program will attempt to get M-JPEG format video out of a USB connected
webcam. Video is stored in a circular FIFO buffer; the buffer size is limited
only by the amount of RAM that can be devoted to it. When a DUMP command is
issued, the circular buffer is marked at a position some number of frames
before the current write position, and the video is written to stdout.
Use this with cheap webcams (i.e. Microsoft Lifecams) and embedded devices
(i.e. MK802s) to put cameras in hazardous locations (i.e. hockey goals).

Commands are accepted on standard input and are terminated by a newline.
They may contain any of the following.

DUMP - dump video
The video buffer is dumped to standard output. A number of frames from
before the DUMP command are sent, then any remaining frames after the
DUMP command. Recording is suspended during the dump operation. The split
between preroll and postroll is currently fixed at 200 frames although
this may be changed in the function dump_buffer() in replay_remote.cpp.

AUTOWHITEBAL - engage automatic white balance
Attempts to engage the camera's automatic white balance function.

WHITEBAL <temp> - manually white-balance the camera
temp: color temperature to white-balance to in Kelvin
This command attempts to disengage the webcam's automatic white balance
function and manually set the color temperature to the provided value.

GAIN <value> - adjust gain/brightness setting
This adjusts the "brightness" control on the camera, which seems like
gain on the Microsoft webcams I've been using.

SHUTTER <value> - adjust shutter speed
Mess with this if you want. I'm not sure of the units. May cause the camera
frame rate to change.

AUTOSHUTTER - try to go to auto-shutter mode
Undo any manual shutter speed adjustments made earlier (hopefully)

FOCUS <value> - Focus the camera manually.
The <value> corresponds to the focus distance.

AUTOFOCUS - Set the camera back to autofocus mode

EXIT - end the program
